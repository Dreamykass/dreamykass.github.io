I like to think I'm a software developer, although I'm mostly just experimenting
with different languages and technologies, as I'm still pretty early in my
programming adventure.

\
I'm currently studying informatics/comp-sci.

\
My favorite techs and langs are, in order 
from most knowledgeable of, and comfortable with:
- `Rust!` - I really love the language, and I think it really is the future. 
  I'm currently making a game in Rust (wgpu, rapier, hecs) for my diploma project, 
  but also did experiment with Rocket a bit, and did a part of the 2020 Advent Of Code in Rust, 
  as means of discovering the language (and falling in love with it).
- `C++` - Specifically, modern-ish C++. 
  I used to experiment with various libraries, like SFML, Asio, ZeroMQ; 
  as well as with pure C++ features like template metaprogramming.
- `C#` - ASP.NET, Razor Pages, WinForms. C# is very cool I think, 
  I really need to find more excuses to use it.
- `web stuff` (JS, HTML, CSS)
- `Go`

\
I also take interest in space, worldbuilding, science fiction, futurology; 
do a bit of drawing and 3D modelling from time to time.
