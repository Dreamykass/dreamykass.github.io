I like to think I'm a software developer, although I'm mostly just experimenting
with different languages and technologies, as I'm still pretty early in my
programming adventure.

\
I'm currently studying informatics/comp-sci.

\
My favorite techs and langs are, in order 
from most knowledgeable of, and comfortable with:
- `Rust!` - I really love the language, and I think it really is the future. 
  I'm writing my game for my diploma project in Rust.
- `C#` - I'm always looking for an excuse
- `C++` - Especially modern C++.
- `web stuff`
- `Go`

\
I also take interest in space, worldbuilding, science fiction, futurology; 
do a bit of drawing and 3D modelling from time to time.
