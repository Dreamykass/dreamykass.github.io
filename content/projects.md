I'm currently working on **Spectrometry**, a game idea I have wanted to (try to)
execute for a long while now, and one I have decided to do for my diploma project. 
It has to be closed-source, until I hand over the project.

And here are my projects, that I'm working on, or that I have finished, in no particular order.
Links are in light orange.

### Projects that I am proud of:
- [spectrometry-devsite](https://dreamykass.github.io/spectrometry-devsite/) - Website for **Spectrometry**. The site is just a simple, static one, but it describes the game, the tools used, goals, and planned features.
- [backpropagation-csharp](https://github.com/Dreamykass/backpropagation-csharp) - Backpropagation neural network implemented in C#, in an easy-to-understand OOP-way.
- [bitsofkass](https://github.com/Dreamykass/bitsofkass) - A bunch of bits and pieces and little projects and examples, of things I experimented with or worked on, in various languages, libraries, and technologies. Mostly C++ stuff.


### Web stuff:
